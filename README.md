Account – Information about bank accounts.

Card – Details of issued credit and debit cards.

Disposition – Relationships between clients and accounts.

District – Demographic data of different regions.

Loan – Information on loans issued by the bank.

Order – Records of financial orders.

Transaction – Historical transactions of bank accounts.
